# ES6 classes
## Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering ES6 classes in JavaScript by completing various tasks that involve implementing classes, inheritance, getters/setters, method overrides, and more.

## Project Tasks
### Task 0: ClassRoom Implementation
Implement a class named ClassRoom that accepts one attribute named maxStudentsSize and assigns it internally. The class should provide a mechanism to access this attribute. If the value passed to maxStudentsSize is less than or equal to 0, the class should return an empty list.

### Task 1: Initialize ClassRooms
Import the ClassRoom class and implement a function named initializeRooms that returns an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with predefined sizes.

### Task 2: HolbertonCourse Class
Implement a class named HolbertonCourse with attributes for name, length, and students. Ensure proper type verification during object creation and implement getters and setters for each attribute.

### Task 3: Currency Class
Create a Currency class with attributes for code and name, providing getters and setters for each attribute. Additionally, implement a method to display the full currency information.

### Task 4: Pricing Class
Import the Currency class and implement a Pricing class with attributes for amount and currency. Provide getters and setters for each attribute and a method to display the full price. Additionally, add a static method to convert prices based on a conversion rate.

### Task 5: Building Abstract Class
Implement an abstract class named Building with an attribute for square footage and a getter. Ensure any class extending from it implements a method named evacuationWarningMessage.


### Task 6: Inheritance
Create a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends Building with additional attributes for floors. Implement getters for both attributes and override the evacuationWarningMessage method.

### Task 7: Airport Class
Implement an Airport class with attributes for name and code. Provide getters and setters for each attribute and customize the class's default string representation.

### Task 8: Primitive - Holberton Class
Create a class named HolbertonClass with attributes for size and location. Customize the behavior when the class is cast into a Number or String.

### Task 9: Hoisting
Fix code that has errors related to hoisting and ensure proper initialization and usage of classes.

### Task 10: Car Class with Clone Method
Implement a Car class with attributes for brand, motor, and color. Add a method named cloneCar to create a new object of the class.

## Conclusion
Embarking on these tasks has provided valuable insights into the power and flexibility of ES6 classes in JavaScript. Through implementing various class structures, inheritance patterns, and method overrides, we've gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming principles and how they apply in modern JavaScript development. This project has not only honed our skills in utilizing ES6 features but also reinforced the importance of proper class design and implementation for building robust and maintainable software systems.
